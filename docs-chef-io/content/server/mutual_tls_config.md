Prerequisites:

- Chef Server
- Chef Workstation

Steps
1. Create a Root C
## Create the Root CA

[Reference]: https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/create-the-root-pair.html

From your workstation connect to your Chef Server and execute the following commands to create the necessary directory structure for your certificate server



```bash
mkdir /root/ca
cd /root/ca
mkdir certs crl newcerts private
chmod 700 private
touch index.txt
echo 1000 > serial
```

Now you need to create an configuration file for your Root CA, named the `openssl.cnf`. See the Root CA example at the end of this document for how we set that up. You'll need to configure the various fields that are marked for you.

Once that file is created and placed in the /root/ca folder, we need to create a key with which we will create the root certificate

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/ca.key.pem 4096

Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword

chmod 400 private/ca.key.pem
```

Now that we have a key, we need to create the Root CA certificate

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl req -config openssl.cnf \
      -key private/ca.key.pem \
      -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca \
      -out certs/ca.cert.pem

Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.

-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name []:WA
Locality Name []:Seattle
Organization Name []:Friedlanders Hosiery
Organizational Unit Name []:IT
Common Name []:Friedlanders Hosiery Root CA
Email Address []:webmaster@friedlandershosiery.com

chmod 444 certs/ca.cert.pem
```

Notice that for the Common Name we used a full proper name and NOT a URL. This is important to do to keep various certificates distinct and distinguishable from each other.

Now you can verify the root certificate

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -text -in /certs/ca.cert.pem
```

### Creating the Intermediate CA

Still connected to your Chef Server from your chef workstation you need to create a new directory structure for your Intermediate CA

```bash
mkdir /root/ca/intermediate
cd /root/ca/intermediate
mkdir certs crl csr newcerts private
chmod 700 private
touch index.txt
echo 1000 > serial
```

Add a `crlnumber` file to your Intermediate CA to keep track of certificate revocation lists

```bash
echo 1000 > /root/ca/intermediate/crlnumber
```

Now you need to create an `openssl.cnf` file for your Intermediate CA. See the Intermediate CA example at the end of this document for how we set that up. You'll need to configure the various fields that are marked for you. You'll also need to configure SAN names for your server as illustrated in the `[ alt_names ]` section. Those alternative names will be used during the creation of the certificate for your chef server.

Once that file is created and placed in the `/root/ca/intermediate` folder, create a key for creating the intermediate CA certificate

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl genrsa -aes256 \
      -out intermediate/private/intermediate.key.pem 4096

Enter pass phrase for intermediate.key.pem: secretpassword
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for intermediate.key.pem: secretpassword

chmod 400 intermediate/private/intermediate.key.pem
```

Now we can create the certificate signing request. Notice once again that we have chosen a distinct Common Name for this CA.

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl req -config intermediate/openssl.cnf -new -sha256 \
      -key intermediate/private/intermediate.key.pem \
      -out intermediate/csr/intermediate.csr.pem

Enter pass phrase for intermediate.key.pem: secretpassword
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.

```text
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name []:WA
Locality Name []:Seattle
Organization Name []:Friedlanders Hosiery
Organizational Unit Name []:IT
Common Name []:Friedlanders Hosiery Intermediate CA
Email Address []:
```

Finally, we can create the certificate for the Intermediate CA

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions v3_intermediate_ca \
      -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 \
      -in intermediate/csr/intermediate.csr.pem \
      -out intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem

Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword
Sign the certificate? [y/n]: y

chmod 444 intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem
```

Now you should test the certificate with the following commands to ensure it was created correctly and that the trust chain between the Root and Intermediate CA's in in tact

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -text \
      -in intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem

openssl verify -CAfile certs/ca.cert.pem \
      intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem

intermediate.cert.pem: OK
```

### Signing Server Certificates

First we need to create a key for your chef server

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl genrsa \
      -out intermediate/private/4thcafe.com.key.pem 2048
chmod 400 intermediate/private/4thcafe.com.key.pem
```

Next we create the CSR file

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl req -config intermediate/openssl.cnf \
      -key intermediate/private/www.example.com.key.pem \
      -new -sha256 -out intermediate/csr/www.example.com.csr.pem

Enter pass phrase for www.example.com.key.pem: secretpassword
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name []:WA
Locality Name []:Seattle
Organization Name []:Friedlanders Hosiery
Organizational Unit Name []:IT
Common Name []:4thcafe.com
Email Address []:webmaster@friedlandershosiery.com
```

Now we can create the server certificate we need

```bash
cd /root/ca
openssl ca -config intermediate/openssl.cnf \
      -extensions server_cert -days 375 -notext -md sha256 \
      -in intermediate/csr/4thcafe.com.csr.pem \
      -out intermediate/certs/4thcafe.com.cert.pem
chmod 444 intermediate/certs/4thcafe.com.cert.pem
```

### Create a Chained Server Certificate File

The final step is to create a chain file that has the server certificate at the top followed by the certificate for the Intermediate CA. This step is important. Clients won't connect properly to the chef server if this step is omitted or done incorrectly. Set this file aside for the next steps

```bash
cd /root/ca
cat intermediate/certs/4thcafe.com.cert.pem \
      intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem > intermediate/certs/server-chain.cert.pem
chmod 444 intermediate/certs/server-chain.cert.pem
```

(root/ca/intermediate/certs/*.pem)
